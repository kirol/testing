Step 1: Risk Identification - The process of identifying risks using techniques such as brainstorming, checklists and failure history
Step 2: Risk Assessment - The process of identifying abd subsequently analyzing the identified project risk or product risk to determine its level of risk, typically by assigning likelihood and impact ratings. Note the distinction made here in terms of project timeline. Likelihood is the likelihood of a problem existing in the software during testing, not the likelihood of the problem being encountered by the user after testing
Step 3: Risk Mitigation (Risk Control) - The process through which decisions are reached and protective measures are implemented for reducing risks to, or maintaining risks within specified levels. Risk mitigation via test execution and other activities
