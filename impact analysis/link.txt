I was personally a big fan of StarUML version 1.

But since the project became commercial, I switched to another forked project: WhiteStarUML.

In the open source (free) version of StarUML there was no support of Annotations and Generics.

The WhiteStarUML project have the class diagram generation from a Java project with a Reverse Engineering tool. Just follow the menu Tools -> Java 1.5 -> Reverse Engineer...

And the following popup appears to choose your Java code location; It can also ask you to put a Java Profile to your current project and just click Yes.
