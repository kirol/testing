I was personally a big fan of StarUML version 1.

But since the project became commercial, I switched to another forked project: WhiteStarUML.

In the open source (free) version of StarUML there was no support of Annotations and Generics.

The WhiteStarUML project have the class diagram generation from a Java project with a Reverse Engineering tool. Just follow the menu Tools -> Java 1.5 -> Reverse Engineer...

And the following popup appears to choose your Java code location; It can also ask you to put a Java Profile to your current project and just click Yes.

While the answer of "No" is technically correct based on the phrasing of the question. You may want to read up on AJAX. It is a way for javascript to make a request to your backend code (in this case Java). Javascript is client side, meaning it is run by the user's browser. Java is running on your server. In order for the client side javascript to interact with the backend Java, you need to make a request to the server.
